Pwn9's origins are in gaming. Our community began under other names as far back as 2003. In 2010 we became Pwn9 and our focus would soon become Minecraft. We hosted some of the earliest survival multiplayer servers and for several years had a thriving Minecraft community.

Over time that's dwindled down and our focus has shifted to other games and to being a small online community. We are not a demanding and organized clan/guild that does competitive play, but we do try to organize some gaming time on occassion.
