We're a community of various people from all over the world, gathered together around gaming, coding, trolling, and... cat videos? 

Actually, we have a little more depth than that, but there is just too much to cover. We are first and foremost an online gaming community, that is the history that has brought us to where we are now. We've evolved and morphed over the years from a Quake Clan (QW - Quake Warriors) in the 90's, to a Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory clan in the 00's (AR - Angel Rebellion then Anarchist Revolution), to Minecraft in the 10's when we relaunched and rebranded as Pwn9.  

Our members play a diverse range of games, or some people are more interested in the tech/programming side of our community, such as development of our Minecraft plugins.

Well, whatever your calling, check us out. The core of our community is all situated in our Discord server, until we get some forums rolling out again. There are far worse options for spending your free time!
