While Pwn9 may be primarily an online community, and gaming our core focus, we've also got a few people who are into development, and our #tech-coding discord channel is one of the most active on our server. Pwn9 has a [GitHub page](https://github.com/Pwn9 "Pwn9 GitHub") for some of our open source work, mostly Minecraft Plugins.

If you are looking for Minecraft Plugins that we've made including the popular PwnFilter chat filter, and PwnPlantGrowth farm limiter, check out our CurseForge page for plugins - [Pwn9 Minecraft Plugins](https://www.curseforge.com/members/tremor77/projects "Minecraft Plugins")

If you're interested in coding, we've got a few experienced developers as well as people just beginning, so feel free to join us on our [Discord Server](http://discord.pwn9.com).
