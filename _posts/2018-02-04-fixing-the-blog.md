title: Fixing up Pwn9 Blog
---
We're going to start fixing up the blog for Pwn9, and seeing if we can get some more people involved in helping to edit and update it. I've kept the blog using Jekyll and hosted with GitHub pages, but I've migrated it to an easier to use setup so that less technical editors from Pwn9 may be able to start chipping in some blog posts.

We should be able to get some more content in here now, so keep checking back in! Now to see if we can theme it halfway decently?
